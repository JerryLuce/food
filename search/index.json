Reduce by 4/5ths. add the brown sauce, and cook for 10 minutes. Pass the sauce through a chinois and add salt and lemon juice; the lemon is used to accentuate the flavors, but it should not dominate. Bring to a simmer, remove from heat, and gently stir in the butter a little at a time (monte au beurre). Poach the marrow by plunging it into lightly simmering salted water. Cook for several seconds and refresh in ice water. Dice the poached marrow and add to the sauce.

Roast them in a hot oven until they achieve a dark brown color. Create a bouquet garni by tying together parsley, thyme, and bay leaf with a piece of string. After roasting, add carrots and onions to the pan with the bones, cooking for 5 minutes to lightly sear the vegetables. Remove the pan from the oven and transfer the roasted bones and vegetables to a sieve. Let them drip over a bowl to eliminate excess fat. Transfer the bones and vegetables to a large stockpot. Add a bouquet garni and garlic, then fill with cold water until it\u0026rsquo;s a few centimeters above the bones. Bring to a boil, skim the scum from the surface, then reduce the heat and simmer on very low heat for 5 to 6 hours. Maintain the liquid level by adding water as needed and continue skimming impurities. Part 2 Cut the meat into large cubes. In a separate large stockpot or saucepan, add a small amount of oil. Sear the meat pieces until they achieve a light brown color. Pour the equivalent of a glass of the previously prepared bone broth over the seared meat. Let it reduce on medium heat until the liquid almost evaporates to a syrupy glaze. Repeat this process two or three times. After the third deglazing, add the remaining bone broth to the pot and bring it to a boil. Skim off any impurities from the surface and then let it simmer for approximately 2 hours to extract flavors from the meat. Turn off the heat after 2 hours and let the stock rest for at least 30 minutes. Pass it through a fine mesh sieve into a clean glass container. For further refinement, perform a second filtering using cheesecloth. Allow the stock to cool at room temperature and refrigerate overnight. Once the stock has cooled, a solid fat layer will form at the surface. Easily scoop it out for other uses.

Bundle the bay leaf, thyme, parsley stems, and peppercorns in a square of cheesecloth, securing the corners with kitchen twine. Ensure one string is long enough to tie to the pot handle for easy retrieval. In a sturdy medium saucepan, melt butter over medium heat until it turns frothy. Add the mirepoix—onions, carrots, and celery—and sauté until lightly browned, approximately 6 minutes, avoiding burning. Gradually stir flour into the mirepoix with a wooden spoon, creating a thick paste known as roux. Reduce heat to low and cook the roux until it lightly browns, around 4 to 5 minutes, without letting it burn. Slowly whisk in the stock and tomato purée, ensuring a lump-free mixture. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce heat to low, and introduce the sachet. Simmer until the volume reduces by 1/3 (resulting in about 2 cups), stirring often to prevent scorching, for 35 to 45 minutes. Use a ladle to skim off any impurities that surface. Remove the sauce from heat, discard the sachet. For a smoother consistency, carefully strain the sauce through a wire mesh strainer lined with cheesecloth. Keep the sauce covered and warm until ready to use. If not using immediately, cool it completely and store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.

Chardonnay 3 tbsp. chicken demi-glaze 1/4 c. freshly grated Parmesan Lemon wedges, for serving Directions Season the chicken with salt and pepper and let it rest for an hour. This helps to enhance the flavor of the chicken. Heat some oil in a cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Add the seasoned chicken to the skillet and cook it until it reaches an internal temperature of 165°F. This should take about 6 minutes per side. Ensure the chicken is cooked through and not pink in the center. Remove the cooked chicken from the skillet and set it aside. Lower the heat to low-medium and add minced garlic, chopped shallots, diced tomatoes, and butter to the skillet. Cook these ingredients until they become tender and fragrant. Deglaze the pan by adding Chardonnay (white wine) and then adding demi-glaze. Deglazing helps to release the flavorful browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Reduce the liquid in the skillet to about half its volume. This step concentrates the flavors. Add spinach to the skillet and simmer it until it wilts. This should only take a few minutes. Stir in heavy cream and grated Parmesan cheese. This will create a creamy and cheesy sauce. Incorporate oregano and basil into the sauce. These herbs will add a nice aroma and flavor to the dish. Return the cooked chicken to the pan and simmer the mixture on low heat. Stir vigorously for about 5 minutes, allowing the chicken to absorb the flavors of the sauce. Serve the chicken dish, garnishing it with lemon, and season it to taste. The lemon adds a refreshing citrus note to the dish.
